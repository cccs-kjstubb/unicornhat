These files are parsed from a matrix generator (link below).  They can be imported directly into the ascii_pic script in pimoroni's examples for the unicorn hat.

1. 8x8upper is a list of uppercase characters
2. 8x8digits is a list of digits
3. 8x8alpha is a list of letters
4. 8x8sym is a list of ascii symbols and some extras
5. 8x8ascii is a numbered list of ascii characters

# keystroke.py

Waits for user input and shows the corresponding keystrokes on the unicorn hat

# test.py

Outputs the 8x8 binary grid to the console for testing shapes
